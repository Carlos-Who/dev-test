## How to run the project

To run this project, first navigate to the project folder from your terminal. For example:


```bash
cd D:\dev-test
```

**Inside the project install all the dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

*Since this project includes both a backend and a frontend, you'll need two terminal windows running simultaneously â€” one for Node.js and one for Vite.*



### Start the Backend

In the first terminal (inside the project directory), run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the backend server using Node.js.


### Start the Frontend

In the second terminal, run:
```bash
npx vite
```
This will start the frontend development server powered by Vite.

If none of the ports are in use, you should be able to access the app at [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
